# Developer Survey Data Analysis Project

**Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing a subset of data obtained from Stack Overflow's Developer Survey. The dataset contains approximately 90,000 entries from survey respondents, and the analysis involves various stages, including data collection, wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization.

**Objectives**

Data Collection: Utilized APIs and web scraping techniques to gather information.

Data Wrangling: Processed the data by removing duplicates, normalization, and handling missing values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explored data distributions, identified outliers, and examined correlations.

Data Visualization: Created visualizations to analyze relationships, composition, and make comparisons.

Dashboards: Implemented dashboards for effective data representation.

**Methodology**

The analysis followed a structured methodology:

Data Collection: Employed APIs and web scraping methods to collect survey data.

Data Analysis: Conducted in-depth analysis, including distribution examination, outlier identification, and correlation analysis.

Data Visualization: Employed various visualization techniques to present findings effectively.

**Executive Summary**

The project begins with a comprehensive understanding of the data context and defining analysis objectives. The methodology encompasses data collection, analysis, and visualization. Results are presented through graphs, identifying trends and patterns. The overall findings and implications are discussed, and final conclusions are drawn based on the conducted research.
